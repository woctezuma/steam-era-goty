# SteamEra Games of the Year Awards 2017

## Goal

A Bayesian Rating is used on [RPGCodex](http://www.rpgcodex.net/content.php?id=10819). However, this methodology is not applied [on SteamGAF/ERA](https://www.resetera.com/threads/steamera-games-of-the-year-awards-2017.19342/), and a sum of scores is applied instead (think Eurovision). Our goal is to use the data shown on SteamGAF/ERA and re-rank games with a Bayesian Rating.
